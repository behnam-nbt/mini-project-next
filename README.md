**Responsive UI:** Optimized layout for different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

**Next.js:** Framework for React that allows server-side rendering and static site generation.

**React Query:** Data-fetching and state management library for handling API data and caching.

**Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

**js-cookie:** Library for handling cookies to store authentication tokens.

#or

yarn build
```
To start the production server:
```
npm start

#or

yarn start
```

## API Configuration

### Axios Instance

The Axios instance is configured in */api/api.js* and is responsible for making API requests. You may need to update the base URL in api.js to match your backend API endpoint.

### Fetch Functions

For example, *fetchProducts* retrieves paginated products data:
```
export const fetchProducts = async (page = 1, limit = 10) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/products`, {
      params: { page, limit },
    });

    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching products:', error.message || error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch products. Please try again later.');
  }
};
```

## Pagination and Client-Side State Management

**Pagination:** The Products page uses React Queryâ€™s *useQuery* with the current page as a dependency to re-fetch data on page change.

**URL Query Parameter:** The current page number is reflected in the URL (*?page=1*), which enables direct access to any page.

## Authentication and Authorization

This project uses token-based authentication managed with **js-cookie**. The token is stored as a cookie upon login and checked on protected routes (like **/products**). When the token is absent, users are redirected to the **/login** page.

**Login Redirect:** On successful login, the user is redirected to the */products* page with a success toast message.

## Usage

**Login:** Navigate to */login*, enter credentials, and submit.

**Product Management:** Access products, search, add, edit, or delete.

**Pagination:** Use the Next and Previous buttons to navigate through paginated products.

**Notifications:** Receive visual feedback for login and product management actions.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
